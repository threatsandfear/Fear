# Fear

What kill human beings? What are the most frequent threats to the survival of our species? Despite more than one-hundred years of research about fear-relevant threats we don't know that much about them. This problem, to some degree, is rooted in the fact that we don't have a comprehensive database for documentation of threats, their frequency, and their economical, social and psychological consequences. For example, it is not difficult to find out that car accidents or cancer are among top ten causes of death worldwide. But in the particular city you live now, are people more likely to be killed by car aaccidents or floods? What percentage of population is killed by accidents and what percentage succumbs to death naturally? The emotion that we experinec in repsonse to threats is fear. (or at least the most common emotion in response to threats is fear). But to understand fear we first need to undersand what provokes it; threats. And to understand threats we need to do what scientists do: measure and quantify. This is the aim of this project.
